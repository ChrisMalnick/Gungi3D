#### Summary

Gungi3D is a chess variant application written in C++ utilizing OpenGL and GLSL. The game hosts a sophisticated ruleset allowing for a potentially deeper level of strategy than that of chess and its contemporaries. While the game does not feature any hidden information, it is up to the players to keep track of the pieces as their markings may become concealed throughout gameplay. Though the game has a high level complexity, it remains approachable as the enforcement of the rules is handled computationally. This alongside the adjustable AI should allow the game to be a decent challenge for players of all skill levels.

#### Features

- 46 total pieces - 23 per side (12 distinct)
- Double-sided pieces hosting 20 unique faces
- Seven abilities - one being an area of effect
- A game board consisting of 81 squares (9 x 9)
- Three ranks (rows) per each player's territory
- Customized initial arrangement of pieces
- Stackable pieces up to three high
- Variable movement based on piece height
- Pieces that invert upon capture
- Pieces that can be placed back into play
- Several potential unique actions per turn
- Nine levels of AI assignable to both sides
- 3D rendered graphics with animations
- Real-time shading with lighting and shadowing

#### Notes

This application is currently only supported on Microsoft Windows based operating systems, and particularly, its target platform is Windows 10. Compatibility with other operating systems is not guaranteed.

The practicality of this game is considerably undetermined as it has gone relatively untested, specifically among different skill levels. The majority of playtesting was done by and against AI with few games being played between actual people. Improvements to the game and the overall quality of the application may come in future updates.
